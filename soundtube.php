               <h2>How to Create Sound Tubes?</h2><br>
               <p>To create a sound tube for your little one and help them connect with the auditory world around them, youâ€™ll only need a few simple supplies. <br><br>

               <b>First</b>, save a few empty paper towel rolls. Next, collect a variety of different materials to go inside each tube like uncooked rice, dried beans, or beads.<br><br>

               <b>Finally</b>, fill each tube with a different material and safely secure the ends of the tubes (duct tape can work for this). Your little one will delight in hearing the different noises these similar looking toys will make!<br><br>

                Remember, little ones often explore with their mouths in addition to their hands so be sure to clean all items, avoid choking hazards, and supervise play.</p>
