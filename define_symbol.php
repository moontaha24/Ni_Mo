      <h2>What is Symbolic Learning!!??</h2><br>
      <p><b>Symbolic Mode (7 years onwards)<b><br>
      
      In the symbolic stage, knowledge is stored primarily as language, mathematical symbols, or in other symbol systems.

      Symbols are flexible in that they can be manipulated, ordered, classified, etc. so the user isn’t constrained by actions or images (which have a fixed relation to that which they represent).

According to Bruner’s taxonomy, these differ from icons in that symbols are “arbitrary.” For example, the word “beauty” is an arbitrary designation for the idea of beauty in that the word itself is no more inherently beautiful than any other word.</p>
