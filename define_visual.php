Information is stored as sensory images (icons), usually visual ones, like pictures in the mind. For some, this is conscious; others say they donâ€™t experience it.

This may explain why, when we are learning a new subject, it is often helpful to have diagrams or illustrations to accompany the verbal information.

Thinking is also based on using other mental images (icons), such as hearing, smell or touch.</p>
