      <h2>What is Enactive Learning!!??</h2>
      <p>In the enactive mode, knowledge is stored primarily in the form of motor responses. This mode is used within the first year of life (corresponding with Piagetâ€™s sensorimotor stage).

Thinking is based entirely on physical actions, and infants learn by doing, rather than by internal representation (or thinking).

It involves encoding physical action-based information and storing it in our memory. For example, in the form of movement as muscle memory, a baby might remember the action of shaking a rattle.</p>
