            <h2>What is Sensory Bin?</h2><br>
            <p>Sensory bins are basically a container full of items with different textures, shapes and colors that kids can play with, either by themselves or alongside friends, siblings or parents.<br><br>


            <h2>How to Create a sensory bin</h2><br>
            <p>Itâ€™s simple for children to enjoy sensory play when you create a sensory bin for them to explore.<br><br>

To create a sensory bin, simply fill a small tub or container with objects from nature such as leaves, rocks, and sand that have different textures for your little one to explore.<br><br>

Or use foods, like large pasta shells along with spoons & scoops, tactile balls, age-appropriate plastic toys, linking rings, small toys to bury and discover and, most simply, water.<br><br>

Remember, little ones often explore with their mouths in addition to their hands so be sure to clean all items, avoid choking hazards, and supervise play.</p>
